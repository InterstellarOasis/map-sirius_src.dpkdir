=============================================================================

	This is the second release of my map Sirius Complex. Compared to
	alpha 1, this release does not have as much changes as I had intended,
	but the changes it does contain could have a significant impact on 
	the overall gameplay.
	

SIRIUS

	After a fierce battle Procyon had fallen. The humans fought 
	long and valiantly, but in the end the station was overrun.

	The High Command knew the battle was hopeless. In secret, 
	a new complex was constructed to prepare for the counter-
	attack, and maybe for all out war.

	The clock is ticking...
