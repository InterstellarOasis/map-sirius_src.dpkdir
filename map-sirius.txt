SIRIUS

	After a fierce battle Procyon had fallen. The humans fought 
	long and valiantly, but in the end the station was overrun.

	The High Command knew the battle was hopeless. In secret, 
	a new complex was constructed to prepare for the counter-
	attack, and maybe for all out war.

	The clock is ticking...
